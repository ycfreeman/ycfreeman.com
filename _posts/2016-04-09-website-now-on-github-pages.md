going full cheapo and migrate my personal website from vps hosted wordpress to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Let's face it, why pay for hosting if you don't make money from it? it's sad but true :p

What I need:

- a website
- or better way a page to serve as the mainpage for my domain name
- well a hub to link to all my wordpress plugin projects
- and a few website projects
- something a little easier than handcrafting htmls by hand

What I don't need:

- WYSIWYG editor - i've done enough [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and html
- ever changing pages contents - why do you need it for a blog or personal website?
- commenting platform - i'm sick of managing a build-in solution, if i need one i'd use managed services.


github pages seems a good fit

what do you think?
