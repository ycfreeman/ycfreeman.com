going full cheapo and migrate my personal website from vps hosted wordpress to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Let's face it, why pay for hosting if you don't make money from it? it's sad but true :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

What I need:

- a website
- a page to serve as the main page for my domain name
- a hub to link to all my wordpress plugin projects
- and a few website projects
- something a little easier than handcrafting htmls by hand
- reliable website that is not hackable

What I don't need:

- WYSIWYG editor - i've done enough [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and html
- ever changing pages contents - why do you need it for a blog or personal website?
- commenting platform - i'm sick of managing spams, if i need one i'd use managed services like disqus.


github pages seems a good fit, and hey it seems to be much faster and reliable than cheapo VPS hosted wordpress!

what do you think?
