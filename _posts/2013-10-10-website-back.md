my AWS free tier is over, $60+ per month for EC2+RDS is a bit too much for my own personal website&#8230;

the site was down for a few weeks, now everything is migrated to a [cheap vps hosting](http://core.weloveservers.net/aff.php?aff=218),it should be fine for another while <img src="http://i1.wp.com/ycfreeman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=660" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1" />
