I&#8217;m converting WOW Recruitment Widget and WOW Server Status Widget�to Git, then push to Github (although I love Google, Github seems easier for you fellas to fork)

**Why?**

so I can track issues better and you guys can fork it for other games much easier :), also prepare for major code�changes, SVN just won&#8217;t cut it if you want to do branches properly.

**Why now?**

just because.

**Why Git?**

because cool kids use Git (it rhymes!), although I uses Mercurial at work, really just want to try out Git, lol.

**When will it be there?**

it takes ages to grab both projects from over 500k checkins in wordpress plugin repo, it will take some time, blame wordpress for why still use SVN.
