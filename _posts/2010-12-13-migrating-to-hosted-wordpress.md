Finally, I&#8217;ve got my own hosted space, lol.

It&#8217;s been a bit awkward to code WordPress plugins while I&#8217;m not using WordPress for my own site :p.

space already purchased, domain will stay the same, changes to all my plugin readme files will be done as soon as I&#8217;ve set it up on the other side.

Demo site will be setup properly, no more cheapo &#8220;free site suspended&#8221; messages&#8230;

and I&#8217;ll also setup a forum for Supporting issues, so no more old school emails or un-threaded comments!

This side will be changed back to ycfreeman.blogspot.com until all migrations are done,

while domain will be moved to new site soon for easier setup

Stay tuned for updates!
