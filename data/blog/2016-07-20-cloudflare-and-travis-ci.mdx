Just a little bit of work and the site is now behind [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for mo' speed (and save those route-53 charges :sweat_smile: it was 50 cents a month!)

and I'm just too _lazy_ to type build commands ... [so yea, more Travis](https://travis-ci.org/ycfreeman/ycfreeman.com)
