This site went down for a few days due to a common AWS micro instance issue &#8212; out of memory and mysqld got killed.

So I went in and [tweaked some apache settings](http://imperialwicket.com/tuning-apache-for-a-low-memory-server-like-aws-micro-ec2-instances) &#8230; also upgraded to apache 2.4+php 5.4&#8230; for maybe slightly lower memory usage&#8230;

hope it won&#8217;t go down again that soon

&#8212; just tried nginx, :frowning: got it running and doing phpinfo() correctly but takes too long to manually setup all these rewriting stuff for wordpress&#8230;&#8230; maybe I&#8217;ll try that again some time

&#8230;. down again, added [swap partition](http://randomind.com/tips/how-to-create-swap-partition-on-amazon-aws-micro-instance-linux-2012-08-29)&#8230;..
