WOW Recruitment Widget was updated to 1.4.1 around 3 months ago, which included the Monk update and bigger icons,

just update from your wordpress plugins panel if you haven&#8217;t :smile:

Latest release note is updated on the Extension gallery page. Please give a 5 star and favorite if you like this plugin.

I&#8217;m converting WOW Recruitment Widget and WOW Server Status Widget to Git, then push to Github (although I love Google, Github seems easier for you fellas to fork)

**Why?**

so I can track issues better and you guys can fork it for other games much easier :), also prepare for major code changes, SVN just won&#8217;t cut it if you want to do branches properly.

**Why now?**

just because.

**Why Git?**

because cool kids use Git (it rhymes!), although I uses Mercurial at work, really just want to try out Git, lol.

**When will it be there?**

it takes ages to grab both projects from over 500k checkins in wordpress plugin repo, it will take some time, blame wordpress for why still use SVN.
