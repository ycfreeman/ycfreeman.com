Thanks Aoife for the info, I didn&#8217;t know Blizzard released their official API.

This plugin is now updated to use official JSON feed, (finally :p), php 5.2+ <strong>required</strong> (for native json_decode() support), although fallback JSON.php for earlier versions is included as well, no garrantee it works in 5.2-, too bad if it doesn&#8217;t work :sad:.

For non-wordpress users, feel free to download the package and extract the wow_ss.php to use it like the [original one](http://53x11.com/blog/2005/04/21/WoW-Server-Status-41.10). (text display mode may contain bugs), more information about [this plugin](http://ycfreeman.com/wow-server-status-wordpress-widget-10/ "WOW Server Status WordPress Widget 1.0")

Changelog

= 1.0.7 =* just re-upload and make sure all files are newest

= 1.0.6 =* patched to use official JSON feed

= 1.0.5 =* fixed bug of space becomes %20 in the new wow_ss.php, thanks Mike

= 1.0.4 =* since official realm status xml is not there anymore, I&#8217;ve modified the original wow server status badge to use \[Axho&#8217;s WoW Feeds\](http://wowfeeds.wipeitau.com/)&#8230; at least for now, feel free to extract the modified badge php for your own use.

= 1.0.3 =* take 2, fixed the apostrophe realm not showing bug in original wow_ss.php, aparently the original script has 3 places doing the same thing, so I merged them to one, and encode it correctly to ANSIit should be fine now if your keyboard is US keyboard, that renders apostrophe as &#039;, sorry for having it not working for so long
