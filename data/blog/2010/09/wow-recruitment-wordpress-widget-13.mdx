Full change log, plugin description after the break.

What’s New in 1.3

**1\. Customizable tooltip**

Tooltip was added last version and in this version I’ve made it customizable with pattern.

Figure 1.1 v1.3 widget settings

Figure 1.1 shows a new option under widget settings, where you can customize tooltip with tokens, mind that these tokens are case sensitive.

\[class\] – will be replaced with customized class text

\[status\] – will be replaced with customized status text

\[note\] – will be replaced with customized note

say you have a pattern like \[class\] | \[note\] |�\[status\]

then you will see something like Death Knight | Blood | Medium when you roll your mouse cursor onto a recruitment item

Figure 1.2 v1.3 customizable tooltip

  

Figure 1.3 one possible usage

so what’s so cool about it?

with the ability to put all those texts to tooltip, now it makes more sense to make a pure icon based recruitment message with my widget!�some possible usage will be like Figure 1.3

(note that I’ve also added note and status css class to item wrapper, so it is now very easy to use different icon/style for different spec, and setting different style for different status)

```css
.wr-status3 .wr-icon
{
    opacity:1.0;
}
 
.wr-status2 .wr-icon
{
    opacity:0.6;
}
 
.wr-status1 .wr-icon
{
    opacity:0.3;
}
 
.wr-status0 .wr-icon
{
    opacity:0.0;
}
 
.wr-icon
{
    border:3px solid #ccc;
    border-radius:10px;
    height:40px;
    width:40px;
}
 
.wr-item
{
    height:40px;
    padding:5px;
    width:40px;
}
 
.wr-note,.wr-status,.wr-class-text
{
    display:none;
}
 
.wr-deathknight .wr-blood
.wr-icon

    background:url(http://vnmedia.ign.com/wowvault.ign.com/icons/Spell\_Deathknight\_BloodPresence\_sm.png) no-repeat;
    border:3px solid #C41F3B;

    border:3px solid #0C81CE;
}
 
.wr-deathknight .wr-unholy .wr-icon
{
    background:url(http://vnmedia.ign.com/wowvault.ign.com/icons/Spell\_Deathknight\_FrostPresence\_sm.png) no-repeat;
    border:3px solid green;
}
 
.wr-shaman.wr-elemental .wr-icon
{
    background:url(http://www.sicaine.net/wowprofiler/img/Interface/Icons/Spell\_Nature\_Lightning.png) no-repeat;
    border:3px solid #2459FF;
}
 
.wr-shaman .wr-resto .wr-icon
{
    background:url(http://www.hotwow.com/icons/middle/Spell\_Nature\_HealingWaveGreater.jpg) no-repeat;
    border:3px solid green;
}

```
well, you get the idea if you have read [the customization post](http://ycfreeman.com/wow-recruitment-wordpress-widget-customization/ "WOW Recruitment Widget � Customization") :smile:

**2\. Added an option to display “Closed” status**

I’ve added this option in a super simple way, just a tick box in plugin settings that enables all “Closed” status to display in front. If this box is checked, it will make all “Closed” status to display.

Say you have 15 rows of �Death Knight in “Closed” status (which is default option of the widget), checking that box will make them all displaying, so you have to set “Rows” in widget settings to a proper row number if this option is turned on.

Figure 2.1 added option to display “Closed” status
