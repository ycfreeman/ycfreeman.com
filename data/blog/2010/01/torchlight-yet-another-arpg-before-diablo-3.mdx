ARPG just like Diablo, hack and slash style, but in 3D and comic style arts. kinda like
[Fate](http://ycfreeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/fate1), but enemies with slightly darker demonic &#8220;diabloish&#8221;
tone, levels randomly generated except important bosses. Single player only. Surprisingly addictive. Some screenshots after the break.
