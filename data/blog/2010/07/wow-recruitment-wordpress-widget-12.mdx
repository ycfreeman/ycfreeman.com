\* ****please save the widget once after upgrading from 1.0.x to make data work with new code**** \*

Update 1/8/2010: I’ve just written a post about customizing this widget with only css codes, have a look :smile:

 

Description

A widget that helps to display recruitment message of a World of Warcraft guild.

This version is updated and tested with 3.0.1 :smile:

**New Features in 1.2:**

\* option to use custom style sheet! \* fully customizable class / status texts! (yea I don’t have much time to hard code multilingual support, so now you can do it all yourself :p) \* customizable number of rows! (yes it’s official now) \* added in recruitment message \* added in a google ad to widget settings for my own good, lol, you can delete that line of code if you really don’t like it.

\*\* row order in widget settings does not affect order that displays in front, it will just automatically sorts by status then class, I will improve this in future version

**Thank you for all your support, stay tuned for updates~**
