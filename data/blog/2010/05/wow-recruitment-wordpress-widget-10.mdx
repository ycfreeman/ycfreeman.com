This widget requires wordpress 2.8+, works perfectly for my guild site which runs 2.9.2.

Tested on 3.0 b1, b2, single site and multi sites, all working perfectly :smile:

**Update 5/29/2010: seems fine on 3.0 RC1 as well. I&#8217;m rewriting many codes and remaking configuration to support sorting and multiple entries per class.
hopefully this major update can be finished when 3.0 goes live or soon after**
