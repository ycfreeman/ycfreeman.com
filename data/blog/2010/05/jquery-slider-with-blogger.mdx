gonna [love jquery](http://sixrevisions.com/tutorials/javascript_tutorial/create-a-slick-and-accessible-slideshow-using-jquery/)

with just a couple of lines, it can make a slider, and it works nicely with blogger structure :smile:
now I can add a nice looking slider to my blogger based portfolio

i can even keep the original post layout and just wrap the slider on top, it just slides the whole block :smile:

Here&#8217;s how:  
simply look for the post loop in your blogger template, which is between

```
<b:loop values="data:posts" var="post">
...
</b:loop>
```

then wrap &#8220;slideshow&#8221; and &#8220;slideContainer&#8221; divs outside the loop and &#8220;slide&#8221; div inside the loop for each post  
others pretty much copy and paste and edit those width and height to fit your site
