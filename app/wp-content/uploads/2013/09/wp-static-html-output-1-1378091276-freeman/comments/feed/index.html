Added an option to display &#8220;Closed&#8221; statusI&#8217;ve added this option in a super simple way, just a tick box in plugin settings that enables all &#8220;Closed&#8221; status to display in front. If this box is checked, it will make all &#8220;Closed&#8221; status to display.Say you have 15 rows of  Death Knight in &#8220;Closed&#8221; status (which is default option of the widget), checking that box will make them all displaying, so you have to set &#8220;Rows&#8221; in widget settings to a proper row number if this option is turned on.Figure 2.1 added option to display &#8220;Closed&#8221; statusChangelog= 1.3.1 = * changed help/bug icons to host at external source, updated license wordings= 1.3.0 =* customizable tooltip!* ability to enable display of &#8220;closed&#8221; status!* bug report icon!Future Improvements:Custom orderMore readable widget settings&#160;Tweet Tagged with: css &#8226; guild &#8226; php &#8226; plugin &#8226; recruit &#8226; recruitment &#8226; widget &#8226; wordpress &#8226; world of warcraft&#160;5 Responses to WOW Recruitment Widget 1.3 Buu-Vi says: October 23, 2010 at 3:57 pmHi !
