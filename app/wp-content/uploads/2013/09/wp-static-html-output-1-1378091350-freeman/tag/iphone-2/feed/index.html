With the launch of iPad, means even more gamers or potential gamers would be using this iPhone OS platform, gaming companies finally begin to make some &#8220;true&#8221; games. Not an old school arcade type of short games, not a lame bluetooth multiplayer game that requires you to sit right next to your component, not a lan only multiplayer game that require everyone to pay $8 before you can have fun, instead, we get a Free MMORPG with purchasable items and contents. Hurray! Short review after the break <img

/>While this is actually pretty much similar to other MMORPG games, I will just review some of the interesting aspects of putting it on an iPhone.</p><p><b>Control</b></p><p>Most important of them is of course, Control.</p><p><a

border="0" src="http://d3ug71ncn5ybxy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_04303.PNG" /></a>Think of it as an ordinary hand-held console type ARPG, controls are fairly straight forward if you have played those kind of games.</p><p>Top left corner we have a character nameplate, which can access to  character sheet, skills and shops. Below that there are hp/mp bars of  your party members. Top middle we have a chat button. Beside that we can see the chat window with some item log.</p><p>At Bottom, we have on-screen D-pad on the left, right side we have a spell book button, 1 big attack button and 4 special ability buttons.</p><p>There are some smaller buttons for some &#8220;less often used&#8221; actions, on the left side, we have a emotion button above d-pad for some non-combat actions like wave or smile, at bottom, we can toggle map, and can access to hp/mp potions.</p><p>Furthermore, you can swipe to rotate camera view, and pinch to zoom in and out.</p><p>Buttons are very packed so it is pretty easy to press the wrong button when you just started to play this.</p><p><b>Store </b></p><div

Free version of the game includes one dungeon of 13 levels, additional dungeon packs can be bought for a few bucks each. Some other things you buy are like extra character slot, more emote actions, and of course some special items. However I do not think you need to buy those extra items, but dungeon packs are worth taking if you want to support their company.</p><p><b>How is it?</b></p><p>So what do I think about it? The idea or showing iPhone&#8217;s potential of handling MMORPG is great, and they really have done a great job on making it smooth like you would have on a computer, but the game itself is a bit too simple.</p><p>Gameplay is pretty basic, you venture through dungeon, kill enemies for experience, gold and equipments. You literally just kill enough mobs to advance a level. Item drop is really random, named mob (sort of boss) will not give you better loot.</p><p>The town basically does nothing but only to show possibility to handle many players on same screen.</p><p>And of course, at the end it still drains battery like any other 3D games and you will have to plug a cable if you want to spend some time on it <img

It is also exciting to see the potential of games with longer play time appear on mobile phones.</p><div
