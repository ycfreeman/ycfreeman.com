Amazon RDS is now in [free usage tier](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/10/amazon-rds-now-available-in-the-aws-free-usage-tier.html), actually it was already available on my last post haha

so of course I&#8217;m already using it, now the website should be fast and reliable, no more memory headache :smile: happy time
